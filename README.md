### TileExchange

Tile Exchanger converts one image into another by splitting the image, then replacing individual tiles.

Only 16x16 tiles are supported right now.

#### Example

Example input, replacement set, and output are available [here](./assets/images/Documentation_Example.jpg "Pastellized Polse Example").
